Known bugs and limitations
**************************

mKEYB relies on the BIOS to do most of the work. It should work on any
machine where the BIOS:
 - uses INT 15,4F to allow for keyboard translation,
 - implements the INT 16,5 service (Keyboard buffer write),
 - populates the Keyboard Flags Bytes at 40:17 and 40:96.

All the required functionalities are present in the IBM XT BIOS after
11/8/82, and in most (all?) AT and PS/2 class machines. The situation
differs for XT clones, where different models implement different
subsets of the three functionalities.

From version 0.48 onwards, mKEYB autodetects the functionalities present
in the BIOS, and install additional handlers to support the missing
functionalities.

If the BIOS do not support INT 15,4F, the /9 switch installs a new INT9
handler that calls INT 15,4F to do keyboard translation. The handler
should work on any machine with a keyboard controller that is compatible
with the 8255 PPI: data buffer at port 60h and status register at port 61h.

With the /G switch, mKEYB installs also a handler for the INT 16,5, if
your BIOS do not have it.

The /9 and /G switch can be disabled with /9- and /G- respectively, if
autodetecs fails to detect them.

*******************************
Standard and enhanced keyboards
*******************************

PC keyboards came in two flavours: "standard" keyboards with 83 or 84 keys,
common on XT class machines, and "enhanced" keyboards with 101 or 102 keys,
common on AT, PS2 and later machines.

From version 0.49 onwards, mKEYB tries to autodetect the keyboard type.
If a standard keyboard is detected, a custom layout for 83/84 keys
keyboards is used, if available. If the custom layout is not available
for the selected language, it patches the enhanced keyboard layout to
use Ctrl+Alt instead of AltGr (not available on standard keyboards).
This pached layout may not be accurate for standard keyboards.

The /E switch forces an enhanced keyboard layout, while /S forces a
standard keyboard.

Confirmed working machines
**************************
 - Amstrad PC5086: real and emulated, chain INT9 needed and autodetected
 - Olivetti PCS86: real machine, no need to chain INT9, BIOS uses INT 15,4F
 - Amstrad PC2086, PC3086: emulated, chain INT9, autodetect do not work
 - Toshiba T1200: emulated, no need to chain INT9 since BIOS uses INT 15,4F
 - Tandy 1000 SL/2: emulated, no need to chain INT9 since BIOS uses INT 15,4F
 - IBM XT: emulated, no need to chain INT9 since BIOS uses INT 15,4F
